## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Development Setup

Make sure Docker and npm are installed, then:

```bash
make start
```

The app will be available at: `https://localhost`

### 📦 Production Deployment

Automated CI/CD is handled by GitLab CI (`.gitlab-ci.yml`) using [Deployer](https://deployer.org/) over SSH:

- Push to `develop` → deploys automatically to **staging**
- Push to `main` → deploys automatically to **production**

Each deployment creates an atomic release (`~/html/releases/<timestamp>`) and switches the `~/html/current` symlink — rollback is one symlink away.

Configuration files:
- `.gitlab-ci.yml` — pipeline (dependencies → code quality → tests → assets → deploy)
- `deployer/deploy.php` — Symfony recipe with hooks (migrations, Vite assets upload, dump-env, Messenger restart)
- `deployer/hosts.yml` — staging and prod host definitions
- `deployer/supervisor/jsd-messenger.conf` — to install on the server in `/etc/supervisor/conf.d/`

Required GitLab CI/CD variables: `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` (protected, masked).

Emergency manual deployment from local: `make deploy-staging` or `make deploy-prod`.

## 🎨 Custom Branding

You can personalize the application’s branding by customizing the project name and logos.

### Project Name
- Set the `PROJECT_NAME` environment variable to change the displayed name throughout the app.

### Custom Logos
- Use the `LOGOS_PATH` environment variable to define paths for your custom logos (light, dark, and icon variants).
- Place your SVG files in the `/assets/images/logo/custom/` directory. For example:
  - `/assets/images/logo/custom/my_custom_logo-light.svg`
  - `/assets/images/logo/custom/my_custom_logo-dark.svg`
  - `/assets/images/logo/custom/my_custom_icon.svg`
  - `/assets/images/logo/custom/my_custom_favicon.ico`
- **Recommended sizes:**
  - Logo: 1800x650px ratio (SVG, scalable)
  - Icon: 64x64px ratio (SVG, scalable)

#### Example `LOGOS_PATH` value
In your `.env` file (escape quotes as needed):
```
LOGOS_PATH="{\"light\":\"assets/images/logo/custom/my_custom_logo-light.svg\",\"dark\":\"assets/images/logo/custom/my_custom_logo-dark.svg\",\"icon\":\"assets/images/logo/custom/my_custom_icon.svg\",\"favicon\":\"assets/images/logo/custom/my_custom_favicon.ico\"}"
```
- The paths should be relative to the `assets/` directory (e.g., `assets/images/logo/custom/...`).
- The application will automatically use these paths for branding in the UI.
